2018 has been a pretty intense year to say the least. It's been filled with a
ton of new experiences, opportunities, and its fair share of drama. I've been
able to make a whole bunch of new friends, finally been to Europe for the first
time, and even had a few opportunities to do some public speaking.

I wasn't really intending to write a blog post this year, but after stumbling
upon another blog with their own "year in review" I felt compelled to write my
own. It's a good chance to reflect on the highs and the lows of the past year
and have a record of them to look back on a few years down the track. Hopefully
I can make this a yearly thing!

## New Job

I joined [Vend](https://vendhq.com) at the start of this year after having moved
back from Wellington to Auckland at the end of 2017. This was an entirely new
role for me, being a role that was primarily using Go and having no prior
experience with the language. This has provided me with a great opportunity to
expand my programming knowledge across multiple languages.

Since the start of the year the team has morphed quite a lot, growing in size
and maturing in focus. I'm looking forward to seeing what we can achieve in the
next year!

And let's not forget all of the epic games of table tennis in the office over
the past year.

## Conferences

### Code Camp Wellington

Code Camp Wellington was a free, 1 day conference hosted at the TradeMe and Xero
offices in Wellington. I was given the opportunity to give my first conference
talk (ever) and I chose to present about developing games with
[Phaser](https://phaser.io).

I'm really glad I had the chance to present here as the conference wasn't too
big and had a very friendly atmosphere, which is a much nicer place to start
giving talks versus diving straight into a much larger, more intimidating
setting.

I thoroughly enjoyed the experience and am looking forward to doing more talks
in the future!

### Nordic.js

I was also lucky enough to be able to attend Nordic.js this year in Stockholm.
This was a single track, 2 day JavaScript conference with a number of speakers
from all over the world.

The topics in this conference ranged from talking about the state of Node.js to
creating your own apps that use blockchain technology. My two favourites were
about [debugging performance issues](https://youtu.be/LFYs7XT5jXI) by
[Anna Migas](https://twitter.com/szynszyliszys) and how to
[control things with your mind](https://youtu.be/X-tpqxC7-co) by
[Charlie Gerard](https://twitter.com/devdevcharlie). Definitely worth checking
those out.

Overall the conference was well thought out and really fun to attend. The food
on the other hand left a lot to be desired!

## Travel

### Sweden

Arriving in Stockholm, I spent the first few days with coworkers exploring the
city and attending Nordic.js. After the conference we all split our separate
ways and I spent the rest of the week exploring other parts of Stockholm as well
as taking the train up to Uppsala.

Stockholm is by far my favourite city in terms of design and infrastructure -
it's so easy to get around! I would love to go back there one day.

### Norway

I arrived in Oslo late at night after my train from Stockholm had been delayed.
Early the next morning I embarked on my homebrew version of the
[Norway in a Nutshell](https://www.norwaynutshell.com) tour (easier to avoid
crowds when you book off peak times yourself). The trip started off with a
scenic train ride from Oslo into the fjords, and arriving in Fl책m via the Fl책m
Railway.

I stayed in Fl책m for a couple of days, soaking in the views (and the rain)
before taking the ferry through the fjord and then continuing my journey via
train to Bergen. After a nice visit to Bergen, I flew back to Oslo and spent the
last couple of days catching up with some friends and exploring the city.

The scenery in Norway was easily the highlight of my year.

## Losses

Of course, this year has had its fair share of sadness as well. At the end of
October my cat passed away at the age of 18. In November my Nana passed away at
the age of 89.

## YouTube

A few years ago I made a [YouTube channel](https://youtube.com/plzbgoodenough)
with a bunch of tutorials around the Dark Web and staying secure online, but
ended up abandoning the channel after uploading a few videos.

I've been working on a bunch of new content over the past month in the hopes of
reviving my channel with some semi-regular content. I've even made a new
[blog](https://deepweb.pw) for it with a few articles already!

## Onward to 2019!

My goals for the next year:

- Start blogging more. It's not something I'm overly consistent with but I'd
  like to add a few more posts here in the next year.
- Grow my YouTube channel.
- Give another talk somewhere, perhaps at a meetup or a conference.
- Contribute more to Open Source projects and get involved with discussions.
- Travel to some more amazing countries!
